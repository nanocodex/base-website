# Welcome to my Github Pages repository!
<p>This site serves as a main page to provide a profile of myself and to connect all other static sites I make in the future in one place.</p>
<p>Some examples of what I plan on making web pages for include:</p>

* Single Page Applications (I need to learn how to make one first though ;-;)
* Blog posts (If I have anything worthy of making a long essay on)
* Websites which serve as a programming exercise for myself
* Creations and achievements I aim to showcase! ðŸŽ‰

<p>Thanks for visiting my Github Pages repository and check out my Github Pages site too!</p>
